This code exhibits an uncommon error related to Objective-C's handling of selectors and message sending.  The problem lies in the dynamic nature of method calls and potential issues with nil values.

```objectivec
//Buggy Code
@interface MyClass : NSObject
- (void)myMethod:(NSString *)param;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)myMethod:(NSString *)param {
    NSLog(@"My Method called with: %@", param);
}

- (void)someOtherMethod {
    NSString *someString = nil; // Potential source of error
    SEL selector = @selector(myMethod:); //Creating selector
    if (someString) {
        //this will not be called due to the nature of someString being nil
        [self performSelector:selector withObject:someString];
    }
    //some logic
    //This part will cause the crash
    [self performSelector:selector withObject:someString];
}
@end
```
The error occurs when `someOtherMethod` calls `performSelector:withObject:` with a nil value. Because `someString` is nil, the second `performSelector:withObject:` call will crash the app. It is not immediately obvious to developers that the selector will not work with a nil value.
